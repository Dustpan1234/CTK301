  <p class="font">My name is Trinity Bauer. This website's purpose is to act as a portfolio of sorts
  to me. I created this website by myself through my web development class at Illinois State University.
  My work is seperated into two catorgies which are visual and audio. This website was created through
the Creative Technologies program as ISU (Illinois State University).</p>

  <p class="font">At this very moment in time, I am a broke college student who is just trying to
  make their way through life. I am quite busy, however I enjoyed the creatiosn I made for this site.
  I hope you can find enjoyment in my creations as well.</p>
